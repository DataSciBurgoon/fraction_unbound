This repository contains a JUPYTER notebook that lays out the development of a support vector regression model to predict the fraction unbound of a chemical in blood plasma.

I then applied the model to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) to obtain an estimate of the fraction unbound in plasma. This information was used to support an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment.
